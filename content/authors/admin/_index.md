I am currently a Post-Doc Research Fellow at [LUMS](https://lums.edu.pk/) working on proposals for research funding and co-supervising a Master's thesis in Computer Science. Additionally, I am working on research related to "Interpretability of AI Models". This research builds on my recent Post-Doctoral experience as a Research Scientist at the [Research for Intelligent Software Engineering (RISE)](https://rise.smu.edu.sg/) laboratory at [Singapore Management University (SMU)](https://smu.edu.sg), ranked fourth globally for software engineering research. My work at SMU involved evaluating human-model alignment for deep-learning-based AI systems, with a particular focus on causal explainability. As part of the _Science of Certified AI systems_ project, funded by the Ministry of Education, I worked with my supervisor [Prof. Lingxiao Jiang](http://www.mysmu.edu/faculty/lxjiang/), to develop methodologies to evaluate the trustworthiness of AI models for code-relevant tasks.

I obtained my PhD degree in Computer Science from the Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS), Pakistan in 2021. My Ph.D. was supervised by [Prof. Dr. Shafay Shamail](https://lums.edu.pk/lums_employee/533) and my PhD committee members included [Dr. Hamid Abdul Basit](https://pk.linkedin.com/in/hamidabdulbasit), [Dr. Basit Shafique](https://lums.edu.pk/lums_employee/28530), and [Dr. Fakhar Lodhi](https://pk.linkedin.com/in/fakhar-lodhi-7697a557) . My Ph.D. thesis is titled "Feature-driven API usage-based Code Example Recommendation for Opportunistic Reuse".
