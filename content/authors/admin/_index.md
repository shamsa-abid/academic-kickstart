I am currently working as a Post-Doc Research Scientist at the Singapore Management University with Professor Lingxiao Jiang. I work on AI models explainablity and trustworthiness. In particular, I am interested in evaluating code models for semantic clones detection.

I obtained my PhD degree in Computer Science from the Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS), Pakistan. My Phd Supervisors are Dr. Shafay Shamail and Dr. Hamid Abdul Basit. My Ph.D. thesis is titled "Feature-driven API usage-based Code Example Recommendation for Opportunistic Reuse".
