abstract: "Searching for code examples on the Internet is commonly and frequently performed by software developers but wastes a lot of their time and reduces their productivity. To aid developers with this problem, a system is needed that can allow them to get appropriate code recommendations for reuse within the IDE. In this paper, we present our prototype tool CodeEase, developed as an Eclipse plugin, which generates method recommendations against the code of the developer. The recommendations are based on clone detection and an analysis of Method Clone Structures (MCS) - a type of structural clones- from a large repository of code."
