title: "PhD Thesis Defense"
summary: "Software developers need to search for reusable code that would assist them in implementing
a given feature or development task. Often, the timely discovery of a critical piece of
information can have a dramatic impact on productivity. Current code search systems focus on
providing code against a specific user query and repeated searches need to be performed until the
code for the desired feature or set of features is found. The problem of repeated code searches
needs to be addressed and a solution is desired for helping developers to get the code for related
features, thus enabling opportunistic reuse for increased developer productivity.
We propose FACER (Feature-driven API usage-based Code Examples Recommender), a recommendation
system that provides developers with method recommendations having functionality
relevant to their feature or development task. The main idea behind FACER is to provide
code recommendations against a feature query based on patterns of frequently co-occurring API
usage-based Method Clone Classes. Such patterns are called Method Clone Structures (MCS)."
