title: "Why P not Q? Interpreting Code Models Decision Making"
summary: "Semantic code clone detection remains a challenging task in the realm of software engineering. While AI models are reportedly accurate, they often fail to generalize to other codebases, raising questions about their reliability and trustworthiness. We need ways to understand or interpret the decision-making behavior of the code models and evaluate whether it aligns with human intuition. In this talk, I will discuss how we can interpret the causes of mispredictions of code models. Furthermore, I will discuss how we perform a causal analysis by systematically perturbing code clone pairs to examine shifts in prediction. Our findings have practical implications, aiding researchers and end-users in choosing code clone detection models more effectively."
